# antennaPositionCalib

A collection of my work on Calibrating the ANITA antenna positions.
Much of this is non-functional... but that's OK since this isn't really for public consumption (if you're not me why are you reading this?)

# Requires

[The ANITA software libraries](https://github.com/anitaNeutrino/anitaBuildTool) and their dependencies.
You should get them.
