# antennaPositionCalib

A collection of my work on Calibrating the ANITA antenna positions.
They're a bunch of c++ progs which loop over the ANITA-3 data and do things.
Much of this may non-functional... but that's OK since this isn't really for public consumption (if you're not me why are you reading this?)

# Requires
## Software
[The ANITA software libraries](https://github.com/anitaNeutrino/anitaBuildTool) and their dependencies.
You should get them.

## Data
A significant portion of the ANITA-3 flight data set (which isn't public).
I've been using runs 145-161 for VPol pulses and 331-354 for HPol pulses.
